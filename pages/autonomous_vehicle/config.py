        Advanced real-time detection system designed specifically for Bangladesh's complex traffic conditions. 
        Utilizes YOLOv11 Medium model enhanced with CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) to detect 
        local vehicles including Rickshaw, CNG, Bus, Truck, Car, Cycle, Bike, Mini-Truck, and People with 
        ~75% mAP@50. Optimized for dense traffic scenarios with occlusions, providing attention-enhanced 
        detection for safer autonomous navigation in challenging urban environments.""",
